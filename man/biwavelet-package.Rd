\title{Conduct Univariate and Bivariate Wavelet Analyses}
\description{
This is a port of the WTC MATLAB package written by Aslak Grinsted and the
wavelet program written by Christopher Torrence and Gibert P. Compo. This
package can be used to perform univariate and bivariate (cross-wavelet,
wavelet coherence, wavelet clustering) wavelet analyses.
}
\details{
As of biwavelet version 0.14, the bias-corrected wavelet and cross-wavelet spectra
are automatically computed and plotted by default using the methods
described by Liu et al. (2007) and Veleda et al. (2012). This correction
is needed because the traditional approach for computing the power spectrum
(e.g., Torrence and Compo 1998) leads to an artificial and systematic reduction
in power at lower periods.

# As of biwavelet version 0.14, the bias-corrected wavelet and cross-wavelet spectra
# are automatically computed and plotted by default using the methods
# described by Liu et al. (2007) and Veleda et al. (2012). This correction
# is needed because the traditional approach for computing the power spectrum
# (e.g., Torrence and Compo 1998) leads to an artificial and systematic reduction
# in power at low periods.

# EXAMPLE OF BIAS CORRECTION:
require(biwavelet)
# Generate a synthetic time series 's' with the same power at three distinct periods
t1=sin(seq(from=0, to=2*5*pi, length=1000))
t2=sin(seq(from=0, to=2*15*pi, length=1000))
t3=sin(seq(from=0, to=2*40*pi, length=1000))
s=t1+t2+t3

# Compare non-corrected vs. corrected wavelet spectrum
wt1=wt(cbind(1:1000, s))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(wt1, type="power.corr.norm", main="Bias-corrected")
plot(wt1, type="power.norm", main="Not-corrected")

# ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES
t1 <- cbind(1:100, rnorm(100))
t2 <- cbind(1:100, rnorm(100))

# Continuous wavelet transform
wt.t1 <- wt(t1)

# Plot power
# Make room to the right for the color bar
par(oma = c(0, 0, 0, 1), mar = c(5, 4, 4, 5) + 0.1)
plot(wt.t1, plot.cb=TRUE, plot.phase=FALSE)

# Compute cross-wavelet
xwt.t1t2 <- xwt(t1, t2)

# Plot cross wavelet power and phase difference (arrows)
plot(xwt.t1t2, plot.cb=TRUE)

# Wavelet coherence; nrands should be large (>= 1000)
wtc.t1t2=wtc(t1, t2, nrands=10)
# Plot wavelet coherence and phase difference (arrows)
# Make room to the right for the color bar
par(oma=c(0, 0, 0, 1), mar=c(5, 4, 4, 5) + 0.1)
plot(wtc.t1t2, plot.cb=TRUE)

# Perform wavelet clustering of three time series
t1=cbind(1:100, sin(seq(from=0, to=10*2*pi, length.out=100)))
t2=cbind(1:100, sin(seq(from=0, to=10*2*pi, length.out=100)+0.1*pi))
t3=cbind(1:100, rnorm(100))

# Compute wavelet spectra
wt.t1=wt(t1)
wt.t2=wt(t2)
wt.t3=wt(t3)

# Store all wavelet spectra into array
w.arr=array(NA, dim=c(3, NROW(wt.t1$wave), NCOL(wt.t1$wave)))
w.arr[1, , ]=wt.t1$wave
w.arr[2, , ]=wt.t2$wave
w.arr[3, , ]=wt.t3$wave

# Compute dissimilarity and distance matrices
w.arr.dis <- wclust(w.arr)
plot(hclust(w.arr.dis$dist.mat, method = "ward.D"), sub = "", main = "",
     ylab = "Dissimilarity", hang = -1)
